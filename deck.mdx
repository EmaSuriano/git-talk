# What is Git? 

- A distributed version control system
  - Created by the creator of Linux
  - after some drama happened over their current version control BitKeeper
  - pretty much the version control with some exceptions

---

It's distributed - Compare this to a centralized source control system like SVN

---

# You should use it for any code based projects

### (and aruguably papers, and presentations too)

It's useful no matter what language you are programming in - Javascript, Java, Python, Go.. whatever

---

# In college I used to zip up individual working versions of my projects.. yuck


* "project_v1.zip"
* "project_v2.zip"
* "project_v3.zip"
* etc.

---

# But, It can be reeeealy frusterating to learn for newcomers

---

# Go back in time
 
* You can review the history of your project!
* Determine when a bug might have been added and test when did that feature last work?

---

# Some vocab

- **Commit**: an incremental versions of your code (the dots below)
- **Branch**: A collection of commits that diverge from master (or another branch)
- **Master**: The main branch of your project

# git add and commit workflow

<Box
style={{
      height: '70vh',
}}
>
<img src={addCommit} style={{
  maxHeight: "100%",
  maxWidth: "100%"
}}/>
</Box>

# Bravely experiment with changes without messing up your project

- You can always go back
- Stash changes for later

---

- **Origin**: The central repo the project is stored at (e.g. at GitHub)
- **Cloning**: Make a copy of the code from ***Origin*** to your machine

---

Let's go pull down a repo from GitHub and look at it

---

# GitHub

The most popular git platform for open source today. 

You should start posting your school projects and any side-projects here to build a profile. Employers do look at them!

Here's mine: https://github.com/fullstackzach

Getting involved in open source is fun too.
  - Work with people around the world
  - Learn new things

---

Lets push our git-demo project to GitHub

1. [Create a repo](https://github.com/new) at GitHub
2. Set the repo as the origin

`git remote add origin {url from GitHub}`

3. push it up to github! [^1]

`git push -u origin master`

[^1] You may need to create a personal access token for the first time
