# Get started with GIT

---

# What is Git? 

- A distrbited version control system
  - every developer has a complete copy of the code

---

# It can be reeeealy frusterating to learn for newcomers

<img src={comic} style={{maxHeight: '70vh'}} />

---

# You should use it for any code based projects

### (and aruguably papers, and presentations too)

---

# Go back and forth in your code - you can review the history of your project

---

# Bravely experiment with changes; You can always go back

---

# Some vocab

- **Commit**: an incremental versions of your code (the dots below)
- **Branch**: A collection of commits that diverge from master (or another branch)
- **Master**: The main branch of your project

<img src={graph} style={{ height: '50vh' }} />

---

- **Origin**: The central repo the project is stored at (e.g. at GitHub)
- **Cloning**: Make a copy of the code from ***Origin*** to your machine

---

Let's go pull down a repo from GitHub and look at it

<Box
style={{
      height: '70vh',
}}
>
<img src={addCommit} style={{
  maxHeight: "100%", 
  maxWidth: "100%" 
}}/>
</Box>

# GitHub

The most popular destination for open source today. 

You should start posting your school projects and any side-projects here to build a profile. Employers do look at them!

Getting involved in open source is fun too.
  - Work with people around the world
  - Learn new things

Lets push our git-demo project to GitHub

1. [Create a repo](https://github.com/new) at GitHub
2. Set the repo as the origin

`git remote add origin {url from GitHub}`

3. push it up to github! [^1]

`git push -u origin master`

[^1] You may need to create a personal access token for the first time
